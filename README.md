🛰️ About Me

Hi, I'm Wu Junzhe, currently a Master’s student in Electronic Information (Artificial Intelligence) at Tsinghua University, Shenzhen International Graduate School (Tsinghua SIGS).
I completed my Bachelor’s degree at Beihang University (BUAA), 2021–2025, majoring in Intelligent Flight Technology.

My interests lie in Embodied AI, 3D vision, 3D Gaussian Splatting, multimodal VLA models, and Real2Sim2Real robotic systems.
I focus on how perception, language and actions can be unified to build agents capable of understanding, predicting and acting in complex environments.
