# 🛰️ About Me

Hi, I'm **Wu Junzhe**, currently a **Master’s student in Electronic Information (Artificial Intelligence)** at **Tsinghua University, Shenzhen International Graduate School (Tsinghua SIGS)**.
 I completed my **Bachelor’s degree at Beihang University (BUAA), 2021–2025**, majoring in **Intelligent Flight Technology**.

My interests lie in **Embodied AI, 3D vision, 3D Gaussian Splatting, multimodal VLA models, and Real2Sim2Real robotic systems**.
 I focus on how perception, language and actions can be unified to build agents capable of **understanding, predicting and acting** in complex environments.
